Landing page:

The user must have an account and input their email and password to log in. If they don't have an account, users can sign up for one by clicking the "Create a new account" link.

Main page:

The user must click the "Add task" button and fill out the fields for task title, task deadline, and task description. Once that is done, a task card will be created on the page. The user can move the card into 3 different lanes: To Do, In Progress, Done. Tasks are able to be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button on the card.

Profile Page:

Users can select a profile picture from the pre-populated avatars. Additionally, users can upload their own picture by clicking "Choose File". Once the user has chosen their picture, they can save it by pressing the "Save" button.

Users can navigate to the "Personal Info" tab in the header to change their first name, last name, linkedin profile, email, and about me sections. The header also provides a "Change Password" tab where users can change their password.
